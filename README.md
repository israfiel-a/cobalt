### CobaltOS
Cobalt is a very small opoerating system built in a mix of NASM assembly and C for x86_64 processors. This is not, by any means, meant to be a daily driver, instead a toy project so I can properly understand the lowest mechanics of a computer.

---

#### Usage
If you, for some reason, wish to build this operating system, a build script is provided alongside the code. Simply run the script and you'll be all good with the newest build.

---

#### Dependencies
In order to build properly, Cobalt needs the following dependencies.

- NASM: The Netwide Assembler. This is the flavor of assembly this project is written in.
- QEMU: A robust virtual machine service. This is just for running the OS--and any VM software will do.
